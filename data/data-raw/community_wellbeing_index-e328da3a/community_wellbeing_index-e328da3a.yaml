  name: Community Well-Being Index
  description: The Community Well-Being (CWB) Index is a method of assessing socio-economic
    well-being in Canadian communities. Various indicators of socio-economic well-being,
    including education, labour force activity, income and housing, are derived from
    Statistics Canada's Census of Population and combined to give each community a
    well-being 'score'. These scores are used to compare well-being across First Nations
    and Inuit communities with well-being in other Canadian communities.
