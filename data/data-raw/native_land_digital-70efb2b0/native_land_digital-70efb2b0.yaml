  description: Native Land is an app to help map Indigenous territories, treaties,
    and languages. The map provided does not represent or intend to represent official
    or legal boundaries of any Indigenous nations. To learn about definitive boundaries,
    contact the nations in question. Also, the map is not perfect -- it is a work
    in progress with tons of contributions from the community. Please send fixes to
    info@native-land.ca if you find errors.
